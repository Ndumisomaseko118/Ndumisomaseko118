What is a Morse code ?
Morse code uses short and long signals called dots and dashes, to represent letters and numbers. Samuel Morse, an American scientist, helped develop it to send messages over a long distance using wires, radios, sound or light. Mesages are sent by tapping, drumming, buzzing, clicking or flashing lights.
